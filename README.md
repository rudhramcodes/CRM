## Implemented Features

> ✅ = Done &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🚧 = In Progress &nbsp;|&nbsp; ⬜ = Pending

### 🔐 Authentication System ✅

**Files:** `server/src/modules/auth/` + `client/src/pages/auth/`

**What it does:**
- User registration with email verification
- Login / Logout with JWT (Access Token: 15min, Refresh Token: 7 days)
- Secure HttpOnly cookies for token storage
- Forgot password / Reset password flow
- Email verification with resend option
- Email verification banner on dashboard

**How it works:**
1. User registers → verification email sent with token
2. User logs in → server sets `accessToken` + `refreshToken` cookies
3. Frontend stores user session in Redux + localStorage
4. RTK Query auto-refreshes token when 401 received
5. Protected routes redirect to login if unauthenticated

**Roles & Permissions:**
| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| Super Admin | Full access to everything |
| Admin | Users, Clients, Projects, Invoices, Payments, Reports |
| Manager | Clients, Projects, Tasks |
| Employee | Assigned tasks/projects only |
| Client | Own projects, files, invoices |

---

### 👥 User Management ✅

**Files:** `server/src/modules/users/` + `client/src/pages/auth/`

**What it does:**
- Create, list, update, delete users
- Assign roles and permissions
- Role-based permission auto-assignment
- User statistics by role

**How it works:**
- Each role has predefined permissions defined in `constants/index.js`
- When a user's role changes, their permissions are updated automatically
- Super Admin can manage all users; Admin can manage non-admin users
- Users can be activated/deactivated

---

### 📋 Lead Management ✅ *(Fully Implemented)*

**What it does:** End-to-end lead tracking system with sales pipeline management, search/filter, notes, and role-based access control.

- **Backend:** `server/src/modules/leads/` — 6 files (Model → Validation → Repository → Service → Controller → Routes)
- **Frontend:** `client/src/modules/leads/` — 5 components + 2 pages + 1 RTK Query service + route integration

#### 🔧 Backend Architecture: Layer-by-Layer

Each layer has a clear responsibility. Data flows through them in order:

```
HTTP Request
  → Routes (lead.routes.js)        — URL routing + auth guard + validation
    → Controller (lead.controller.js) — Parse request, call service, send response
      → Service (lead.service.js)      — Business logic (no DB knowledge)
        → Repository (lead.repository.js) — Database queries only
          → Model (lead.model.js)         — Mongoose schema + indexes
```

##### 1. Model — `lead.model.js`

Defines the MongoDB schema with all fields, validation rules, and indexes:

```javascript
{
  name:           String (required, 2-200 chars),
  email:          String (required, unique, lowercase),
  phone:          String (optional, regex validated),
  company:        String (optional),
  source:         String (enum: google_ads, referral, instagram, linkedin, website, email, call, other),
  status:         String (enum: new, contacted, meeting_scheduled, proposal_sent, won, lost),
  assignedTo:     ObjectId → ref: 'User',
  createdBy:      ObjectId → ref: 'User',
  convertedToClient: ObjectId → ref: 'Client' (nullable),
  followUpDate:   Date (nullable),
  notes: [{
    text:       String (required),
    createdBy:  ObjectId → ref: 'User' (populated with name, email, avatar, role),
    createdAt:  Date (auto)
  }]
}
```

**Indexes:** `phone`, `status`, `assignedTo`, `source`, `createdAt` (desc), text index on `name + email + company` for search.

##### 2. Validation — `lead.validation.js`

Zod schemas for all endpoints. Key validations:

| Schema | Key Rules |
|---|---|
| `createLeadSchema` | name: min 2 chars, email: valid email, phone: optional regex, source: enum, status: enum |
| `updateLeadSchema` | All fields optional, at least one required |
| `addNoteSchema` | text: min 1 char |
| `leadsQuerySchema` | search: optional, status/source/assignedTo: optional enum, page/limit: optional positive ints |

##### 3. Repository — `lead.repository.js`

Handles ALL database interactions. No business logic here:

- `create(data)` — Insert new lead
- `findById(id)` — Single lead with populated `assignedTo`, `notes.createdBy` (name, email, avatar, role), `createdBy`
- `findByEmail(email)` — Duplicate check
- `findAll(query, options)` — Paginated list with text search (`$regex` on name/email/company/phone), status filter, source filter, assignedTo filter. Populates `assignedTo`. Returns `{ leads, pagination }`.
- `updateById(id, data)` — Update with `runValidators: true`, returns populated doc
- `deleteById(id)` — Hard delete
- `countByStatus()` — Aggregate pipeline grouping by status for stats dashboard
- `countAll(filter)` — Total count for pagination metadata

##### 4. Service — `lead.service.js`

Business logic layer. Controllers call services, services call repositories:

| Function | Logic |
|---|---|
| `create(data, user)` | Checks duplicate email via repository, sets `createdBy` and `createdBy` from logged-in user, calls repository.create |
| `getAll(query, options)` | Delegates to repository.findAll |
| `getById(id)` | Delegates to repository.findById |
| `update(id, data, user)` | Delegates to repository.updateById |
| `remove(id)` | Delegates to repository.deleteById |
| `addNote(id, noteData, user)` | Pushes note with `createdBy: user._id` to the notes array |
| `getStats()` | Aggregates counts by status + total count |

##### 5. Controller — `lead.controller.js`

Thin layer — parses request, calls service, wraps response:

```
list(req, res)     → GET / → leadService.getAll(query, pagination) → ApiResponse
getById(req, res)  → GET /:id → leadService.getById(id) → ApiResponse
create(req, res)   → POST / → leadService.create(body, req.user) → ApiResponse.created
update(req, res)   → PATCH /:id → leadService.update(id, body, req.user) → ApiResponse
remove(req, res)   → DELETE /:id → leadService.remove(id) → ApiResponse
addNote(req, res)  → POST /:id/notes → leadService.addNote(id, body, req.user) → ApiResponse
stats(req, res)    → GET /stats → leadService.getStats() → ApiResponse
```

##### 6. Routes — `lead.routes.js`

All routes require `verifyToken` middleware. Role-based authorization per endpoint:

```
GET    /api/leads/stats    → super_admin, admin, manager
GET    /api/leads          → super_admin, admin, manager, employee
GET    /api/leads/:id      → super_admin, admin, manager, employee
POST   /api/leads          → super_admin, admin, manager
PATCH  /api/leads/:id      → super_admin, admin, manager
DELETE /api/leads/:id      → super_admin, admin
POST   /api/leads/:id/notes → super_admin, admin, manager
```

Input validation applied via `validate()` (body) and `validateQuery()` (query params) middleware using the Zod schemas.

```

**API Integration — `leadApi.js` (RTK Query)**

Uses `injectEndpoints` to add lead endpoints to the base API:

| Endpoint | Hook | Cache Tags |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /leads` | `useGetLeadsQuery(params)` | `'Lead'` |
| `GET /leads/stats` | `useGetLeadStatsQuery()` | `'LeadStats'` |
| `GET /leads/:id` | `useGetLeadByIdQuery(id)` | `'Lead'` |
| `POST /leads` | `useCreateLeadMutation()` | `'Lead'`, `'LeadStats'` (invalidates on success) |
| `PATCH /leads/:id` | `useUpdateLeadMutation()` | `'Lead'`, `'LeadStats'` |
| `DELETE /leads/:id` | `useDeleteLeadMutation()` | `'Lead'`, `'LeadStats'` |
| `POST /leads/:id/notes` | `useAddLeadNoteMutation()` | `'Lead'` (single lead re-fetched) |

All mutations invalidate or update the relevant cache tags automatically — no manual refetch needed.

**UI Components Used:**
- `Select.jsx` — shadcn/ui Radix Select (all dropdowns use this, not native `<select>`)
- `FormSelect.jsx` — Form wrapper with `react-hook-form Controller` + shadcn Select
- `FormInput.jsx` / `FormTextarea.jsx` — Form input wrappers
- `DataTable.jsx` — Reusable sortable, paginated, searchable table
- `Modal.jsx` — Reusable modal for edit form
- `Button.jsx` — Variants: primary, secondary, danger, ghost, outline
- `Loader.jsx` / `EmptyState.jsx` — Loading and empty state placeholders
- `LeadKanbanBoard.jsx` — Kanban pipeline with @dnd-kit DnD context, droppable columns, DragOverlay
- `LeadKanbanCard.jsx` — Sortable card using `useSortable` hook with CSS transform animations

#### 📚 How to Use — Step by Step

**As a Super Admin / Admin / Manager:**

1. **Access:** Navigate to **Leads** in the sidebar
2. **View pipeline stats:** Stats cards at the top show lead count per status
3. **Search/filter:** Type in the search box to find by name/email/company, or use the Status/Source dropdowns
4. **Create a lead:** Click **Add Lead** → Fill in Name*, Email*, Phone, Company, Source, Status, Notes → Click **Create Lead**
5. **View lead detail:** Click any row in the table → See full contact info, status badge, source, notes timeline
6. **Edit a lead:** On the detail page, click **Edit** → Modify fields → **Update Lead**. Or click the edit icon on any table row to go directly to the detail page.
7. **Add notes:** On the detail page, type in the notes input and click **Add**. Each note shows the author name, role, and timestamp.
8. **Delete a lead:** Click the delete icon on a table row, or the Delete button on the detail page → Confirm

**As an Employee:**

1. View the lead list and lead details (read-only)
2. No create/edit/delete/notes functionality
3. Can search and filter

**Role behavior on the /leads/new page:**
- Top-left **← Back** button navigates back to the leads list
- If you change your mind while filling the form, click Back — no data is saved
- All fields are validated before submission with inline error messages
